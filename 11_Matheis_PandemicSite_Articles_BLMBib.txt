Resource: COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, and The Daily Nebraskan
During the summer of 2020, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests erupted after the murder of George Floyd.

For this post, I was specifically interested in looking at the way that the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s student newspaper, The Daily Nebraskan, covered the Black Lives Matter protests during the pandemic, student opinions on and related to BLM, and coverage of on-campus events or statements related to the movement. Though Black Lives Matter started in 2013, I decided to continue researching articles about BLM and discussing race dating back to the early 2000’s in order to gain a sense of how the discourse on race has changed on UNL’s campus over time. These articles represent various perspectives on these topics.

Disclaimer: This is not an exhaustive bibliography, nor does it contain articles relating to race published in The Daily Nebraskan prior to the early 2000’s.
