Tool Analysis: GeoJSON, GitHub, StoryMap, and Pen & Paper
I really enjoyed the creativity involved in using all three of these tools and thinking of the best to communicate the data or story that I was trying to tell on these platforms. I did the pen and paper exercise after experimenting with GeoJSON, GitHub, and StoryMap. After experimenting with tools that were designed with (at least the appearance of) the intention of creating a specific way of presenting data, the possibilities of pen and paper—with no coding or internet/web-based restrictions—was almost overwhelming. Having a blank slate gave me several ways to present my data, but it also informed my earlier experimentation with GeoJSON, GitHub and StoryMap.  

I’ll admit that, with my HTML experience limited to what I’ve learned in literally the last week because of my work at the Central Online Victorian Educator (COVE) and the Walt Whitman Archive, I felt a bit out of my league at first with GitHub.  I actually re-watched the GitHub tutorial and built my site along with it to make sure I got the hang of it. I think once you understand the workings of the site though, it becomes a pretty convenient site, especially in situations like ours where we are learning about this for the first time. GeoJSON was definitely more technical than StoryMap in terms of map and site building, but after messing around with it and especially with Ms. Dussalt’s tutorial video, I found it pretty easy to navigate. I also think that having the coding on the right hand side of the interface makes it appear more complicated in the beginning. I do think though, that StoryMap is more accessible than GeoJSON/GitHub to people that don’t necessarily have the HTML experience. It felt reminiscent of PowerPoint and Canva, tools that are likely familiar to more people than the GitHub of GeoJSON. 

That being said, once I got to the pen and paper exercise and after experiencing the other platforms, I almost felt limited in how interactive I could make it despite feeling that there were many ways my data could be visually presented; no information could be revealed by clicking on a map marker, for example. And so, I thought about ways that I could make my data visualization even minutely interactive on a flat piece of paper. I decided to write along my map pathways. If you were holding the piece of paper, you’d have to turn the paper to read some of the information on my “map.” 

 I think pen and paper would be more effective in somehow mapping my data if I was working with medium that was physically larger than a piece of computer paper so that I could expand my narrative in places a bit more. There would literally be more room for creativity. In terms of scale of a map and the geographical space or locations that could be represent, GitHub and GeoJSON seem to be the best option for a more localized map, like of a city of campus. Because you could easily type in any set of coordinates or locations, and because we were limited to map options, StoryMap would be more effective for a global or country-based map.
