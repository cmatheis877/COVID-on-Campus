My name is Caitlin Matheis and I created this project for one of my graduate digital humanities courses at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, aiming to document how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted UNLâ€™s campus and the city of Lincoln. Through written articles, photos, and other resources, I hope that this project can give you a small glimpse into what life in Lincoln is like during a global pandemic.
