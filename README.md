# COVID-on-Campus
## By Caitlin Matheis

This project was created to provide site visitors to get a small sense of what living
in Lincoln, Nebraska and attending the University of Nebraska-Lincoln was like during 
the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. This project specifically aims to document the changes 
that occurred to UNL's campus and to downtown Lincoln as a result of the virus, but also
emphasize the cultural effects of the virus.
