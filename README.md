the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. This project specifically aims to document the changes 
that occurred to UNL's campus and to downtown Lincoln as a result of the virus, but also
# URLs associated with COVID-on-Campus

Several different URLs have been used to create the COVID on Campus
site. The links used are listed below.

Most of the site was created using Wordpress. The Wordpress site holds the About page and description of the project, as well as the writing about the coronavirus in Lincoln. Here is the link to the main landing page of COVID on Campus: [Wordpress Landing Page] (https://cmatheis877.wordpress.com/)

One resource used to help organize the site is Flickr. This helps better organize the photos related to the project. The photos can be tagged and organized into albums, and makes more thorough metadata readily available to viewers than if the photos had been uploaded onto Wordpress. The Flickr page is linked externally under "Photos" on the main menu of the site. Here is the link to the Flickr page: [Flickr albums] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/covid_on_campus_unl/albums/with/72157716023545213)

The last external resource used to create the COVID on Campus site was KnightLab's StoryMap tool. A GeoJSON map was uploaded into StoryMap to provide a visual representation of the effects of the coronavirus in downtown Lincoln. Here is the link to the StoryMap: [Lincoln StoryMap](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/113da5cc1b219e5f16769d9b29f0bd47/lincoln-nebraska-during-covid-19-pandemic/index.html)
