Try out a COVID-inspired, Star Wars-themed game!
I created an online game inspired by the coronavirus. Try it out here. To learn about how it was created, keep reading. Have fun!

At first I was a bit overwhelmed with all of the functions of the Star Wars game. I had fun messing around with all of them – I ended up just putting a ton of random functions together just to see what would happen. One of the random functions I put together allowed the storm troopers to multiply, so much so that it was almost impossible to see the targets in order to win the game. Which gave me my idea for my game. The way to win the game is to collect all of the droids on the game board. I thought of these as the “solutions” to the pandemic—a vaccine, nobody getting sick, etc. But, every time you hit the up arrow, storm troopers enter the screen.  Even as more droids come onto the screen, it gets harder and harder to find them because the number of storm troopers is overwhelming…representing the flux of cases in the country. The trick is, that all of the storm troopers come towards you, so if you stay still—kind of like quarantining!—they’ll all go away and you can clearly see the solutions. But of course, once you try to reach them or think it’s all clear, you will likely end up hitting the up button to win, and some more troopers will appear.
